Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read number n (Here n is the number of numbers)
Step 3: Declare Sum to 0 and count to 1 
Step 4: Repeat steps 5 to 7 until count<=n
Step 5: Read number num
Step 6: update sum as Sum = Sum + num
Step 7: increment count by 1
Step 8: if num < 0 go to step 8, if not repeat step 4
Step 8: Print Sum
Output: Sum
